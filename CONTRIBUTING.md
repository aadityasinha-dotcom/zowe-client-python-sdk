# Contributing

This document contains the contribution guidelines for the Zowe Client Python SDK.

Notice that the Python SDK is still in early development stages, meaning that major architectural changes might be made by the development team at any given moment. **For this reason, only bug fixes and documentation changes are being accepted as contribution at this moment** . This document will be updated as soon as the stable release of the SDK is published (v1.0.0)
